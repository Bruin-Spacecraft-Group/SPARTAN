Any model GPS never implemented/tested.

These files constitute multiple beginning steps for implementing various GPS modules.

Note: Look into code for GPS position logging via RaspberryPi and C code (obviously would need to change to be in accordance with the other code we have already in C++)

Note (01/08/2020): these files are example code only. The actual GPS code lives in the gps/
folder, and relies on a gpsd-based implementation rather than an Adafruit_GPS-based one.
