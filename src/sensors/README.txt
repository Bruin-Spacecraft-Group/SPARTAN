NOTE: Sensor implementations include "sensor.h" header file, and since filetree has been updated, will need to account for this.
Code compilation will likely not work until this is figured out (suggestion: make a "headers" file in src? or a build folder that
is organized like a regular software application would, and not a library organization like this is?)
